# Ideation For StackUp's Discord Server.
            
Issue Existing On Server :- None 

Idea For Discord Server 1 :- I Want To Suggest Game Nights On Every Saturday Or Sunday Nights Which Will Increase The Server Engagement And Will Attract The Non-Active Users Of The Server To Become More Active. It Doesn't Have To Be A Big Official Event But Presence Of A Mod To Handle An Unlikely Scenario Of Cheating Might Be Preferable. The Games Could Include Gartic Or The Games Which Are Available On Discord When Joining A Voice Channel (Under The Activities Sections) And Win Stackcoins. For Small Games Like Gartic Or Similar Games, A Reward Of 1000 Coins For 1st, 750 For 2nd And 500 For 3rd Place Is Recommended. And For Big Games Like Valorant Or Pubg Or Free Fire, Scaling Of The Reward Can Also Be Doubled For Each Respective Place. 

Here Are Some Of The Games That Can Be Played On Game Nights

Idea For Discord Server 2 :- Every Quiz Should Have One More Winner Other Than The Predefined Number Of Winners. And This Extra Slot Should Go To A Lucky Winner Winning About 500 To 1000 Stack Coins. This Will Motivate More Users To Attend Quizzes.
